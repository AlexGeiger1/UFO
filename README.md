# UFO

# Objective

## Purpose
The purpose was to create a website that uses a dynamic table of recorded UFO sightings throughout the world. This table allowed for filtering where the users can select specific criteria; city, state, country, shape, and date. These criterias were used to filter the table to the specific results the user selected. The main purpose of this website was to create a detailed analysis of UFO sightings. 
# Results

## Using the Website
- enter 1 or more of the following criteria

# Summary 

## Drawback
The table does not have a reset function so resetting the table has to be done manually after one criteria has been evaluated. 

## Further Development
- Firstly, a reset button needs to be added to the table so that after one set of criteria has been entered a new one can be added later. 
- Secondly, instead of having the user manually type in the search criteria, a drop down list of available criteria should used as a replacement.
